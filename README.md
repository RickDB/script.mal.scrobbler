# script.mal.scrobbler
Kodi to MyAnimeList scrobbler

This Kodi addon will push the following Anime series info to a MyAnimeList list like

- Now playing
- Completed
- Amount of episodes watched

Currently requires a separate ASP.NET backend for matching (based on PlexMALSync) but in future updates want to make it pure Python by utilizing the Python-mal library.
